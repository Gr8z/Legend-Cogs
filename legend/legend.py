cw_info = """We organize **Legend Wars** every weekend, which aims to determine **which clan is the strongest**.

The **idea** is simple: A private tournament that anyone may join **within Legend Family and the alliance.**
Score is calculated in a way that allows every participant to contribute to help their clan win.  We sum the earned tournament trophies of the members of each clan to calculate a clan score, clan with highest clan score is declared the **winner**!

There are 2 factors to win: convince more players to participate within your clan and earn more tournament trophies. Both are **equally important**. We publish tourneys and passwords at same time, so we give equal chances to each clan and player.

The Top player in each war will recieve $10. However, each and every participant will recieve discord credits for getting trophies for their clan. The more trophies you can collect, the more credits you will get. Credits can used in LeGeND shop to buy various items.

**All clans** will be closed/full to avoid any leaks, nobody will be allowed to join.

**3 golden Rules for Legend Wars:** We respect the Opponent (no BMing if you win), we play to have fun (no obligation to participate), and don't join if you think you cannot play.
"""

credits_info = """**WHAT ARE CREDITS?**
Credits are a virtual currency in LeGeND Discord, you earn credits by playing in Legend Wars, donating, and playing mini games in discord. To use your credits, you can buy items using !buy.

• Every 30 minutes, you can get free credits by typing !payday in #bot-spam channel.
• Every Sunday, you receive something called a "Weekly Payout". Which converts all your week's clan donations, War Cards collected and War wins into credits. So the more active you are in a clan, the more credits you get.
• We have Legend Wars every weekend, participating in these wars also give you tons of credits according to your tournament trophies.
• You can also win credits by playing #heist and #challenges.
• You can play Clash Royale #duels to bet on your skills in friend battles.
• Last but not least, you can get easy credits by just chatting on discord. The more you chat, the more credits you accumulate.

You can type !buy here to look at different ways you can spend these credits.
